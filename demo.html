  <h1>Smart City Demo</h1>
  <p>
    Here is a demo for the R cloud on HTML. For Wordpress, we need self-hosted version of WordPress.org instead of Wordpress.com to implement the html code. 
    We also needs to install  Reframer plugin in the Wordpress.org (to have that, we have to upload the Wordpress to business version.)
    Then put the code in this code snipet in the wordpress, and it will work!
